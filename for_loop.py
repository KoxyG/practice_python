#for loop is used to iterate over a sequence, which could be a list, tuple, array or a string
#syntax:        For COUNTER IN SEQUENCE:    #counter is a variable that keeps tract in the position you are in, in a sequence
#                           statement(s)
#i assumes the value of the first element in x, prints with a \n the value & everytime it goes back in the loop it is incremented by 1

x = [1, 6, "Koxy"] #it should be a list not a dictionary
for i in x :
    print(i)
